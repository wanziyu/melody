# Melody
Melody is an online scheduling framework for 
edge computing ML model inference on Kubernetes. 

## Overview
Melody uses Deep Q-learning as the base scheduling algorithm, use prometheus to monitor Edge computing resources and input metrics to DQN, and obtain the optimal scheduling decesion.
